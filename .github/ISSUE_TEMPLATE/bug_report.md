**Describe the bug**
Please give a clear and concise description of the bug. For us to be able to
fix the bug we need to be able to reproduce it. As a result, if you provide a
reproducer, i.e. code exhibits the bug (incl. build instructions) but is
stripped of all unessential complexity, the chance of getting the issue fixed
is much higher.

**Style Guide**
1. Please paste text as text and not as a screen shot.
2. If in doubt paste too much output rather than to little, i.e. don't be too
   scared of a large wall of text. Especially, if it's a compiler error.
   (Anything past the first error is largely uninformative and can be safely
   stripped.)
3. Please strip all boilerplate.
